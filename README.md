## Image_Caption_Generation
Image caption generation, the task of automatically generating descriptive captions for images, plays a vital role in bridging the gap between visual content and natural language understanding

## Methodology
To extract relevant and meaningful visual features from the images, we explore several popular and state-of-the-art pre-trained deep learning models for feature extraction. These models include ResNet50 (Residual Neural Network), DenseNet201, VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group),  InceptionNetV3, and XceptionNet. Each of these models has demonstrated strong performance in various computer vision tasks and has been widely adopted in the research community
